# Zomato-EDA
About Dataset
The dataset provides a comprehensive view of the restaurant scene in the 13 metropolitan areas of India( 900 restaurants). Researchers, analysts, and food enthusiasts can use this dataset to gain insights into various aspects such as dining and delivery ratings, customer reviews and preferences, popular cuisines, best-selling items, and pricing information across different cities. It enables the exploration of dining patterns, the comparison of restaurants and cuisines between cities, and the identification of trends in the food industry. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for understanding the culinary landscape and making data-driven decisions related to the restaurant business, customer satisfaction, and food choices in these metropolitan areas of India. In this dataset, we have more than 123000 rows and 12 columns, a fairly large dataset. We will be able to get hands-on experience while performing the following tasks and will be able to understand how real-world problem statement analysis is done.

üöÄ Analysis Overview
The project follows a structured approach to analyze the data, from cleaning to drawing conclusions.

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Null values in Dining_Rating, Delivery_Rating, and Best_Seller columns were identified and imputed. For instance, NaN in Best_Seller was replaced with "NA".

Data Standardization: Inconsistencies in the City column were resolved. For example, localities like 'Banaswadi' and 'Ulsoor' were correctly mapped to 'Bangalore'.

2. Feature Engineering
New features were created to facilitate deeper analysis:

total_votes: The sum of Dining_Votes and Delivery_Votes to measure overall engagement.

Total_rating: The sum of Dining_Rating and Delivery_Rating to create a combined performance score.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The core of the project involved answering key business questions through visualization:

Restaurant Distribution: Visualized the number of restaurants in each city to identify market size and saturation.

Popularity Analysis: Identified the top-rated and most frequently listed restaurants in each city.

Price Analysis: Compared average item prices across cities and identified the most and least expensive cuisines.
